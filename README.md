For business discussions and/or inquiries only use my email address.

  
Introduction: 
  I’m interested in Software Development with high emphasis on GUI Development and User Interface Engineering.
  I am also highly interested in Networking and Filesystem Level programming. 
  My interest in databases are a little lower compared to those above,
  because data storage can be performed in filesystem in many applications.
  
  I’m looking to collaborate on any project that i can learn to do things better while also adding value. 
  I don't contribute to projects to learn something from scratch unless it's a very narrow scope, 
  I tend to prepare for it before starting to work on a project.
